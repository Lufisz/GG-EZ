# **GG-EZ - Esports Event Tracker (Frontend)**

[View live project here!](https://gg-ez-750b5184ca87.herokuapp.com/)

---

## **Project Rationale**

GG-EZ is all about making it easier and more enjoyable to keep up with esports tournaments, matches, teams, and players. This project is the **frontend** of the [GG-EZ platform](https://github.com/lufisz/GG-EZ), creating a smooth, interactive, and user-friendly experience for everyone who loves esports.

The frontend was built with **React**, a powerful tool that helps create a fast and responsive interface. Whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer, GG-EZ is designed to look great and work seamlessly. By connecting to the [backend API](https://github.com/lufisz/GG-EZ-API), it ensures users can explore esports events and details effortlessly, while keeping the design simple and easy to navigate.

## **Note for Testing and Assessment**  
- Most **CRUD features** are implemented in the **Admin Panel**.  
- During registration, users can select between:
  - **Default User**: Standard user access.
  - **Staff User**: Custom role with access to the **Admin Panel** for editing website data.  
- The **Staff User role** is separate from Django's admin panel, which is reserved for developers.

---

## **Project Overview**

GG-EZ is a responsive, interactive platform for tracking esports events, teams, and matches. Built using **React** and integrated with a **Django REST API**, the app allows users to explore events, matches, and teams while providing administrators with tools to manage data seamlessly.

---

## **Goals of the Project**

The main goal of GG-EZ is to provide esports enthusiasts with an accessible, user-friendly platform to explore and stay updated on events, matches, teams, and players. This project also aims to offer administrators an efficient way to manage data through a responsive and modern interface. By combining a robust backend API and an interactive frontend, GG-EZ ensures a seamless experience for users and staff alike.

#### **Frontend Component Tests**
- **MatchesPage and MatchesDetailPage**: Verified that matches display correctly, including loading states, error handling, and ensuring data fetched from the backend renders as expected.
- **EventsPage and EventsDetailPage**: Checked for accurate data fetching and rendering of event details under various scenarios, including edge cases.
- **SignUpForm and SignInForm**: Validated input fields, error messages for invalid data, and the successful flow for user login and registration.
- **CustomToast Component**: Ensured proper rendering of toast notifications, verifying styles, dynamic behavior, and onClose functionality.
- **Navbar and Footer Components**: Confirmed correct rendering, links, copyright information, and responsiveness.

#### **Admin Panel Tests**
- **PlayersAdmin and TeamsAdmin**: Focused on CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and verified functionality such as pagination, filtering, and API mocking to simulate real-world backend behavior.
- **EventsAdmin**: Tested the management of events, including advanced filtering, pagination, and error handling scenarios.

#### **Custom Hooks**
- **useClickOutsideToggle Hook**: Ensured proper behavior for toggling elements based on outside clicks, improving accessibility and user experience.
